- **1a.**

The greedy algorithm would repeatedly select the coin of highest denomination that can fit, doing so over and over again until reaching the given dollar amount. Given that the set of denomination is singular (base 2) and we have a fixed dollar amount, the greedy algorithm is optimal here. 



- **1b.**

W(n) = O(log(n)) and S(n) = O(log(n)) because the algorithm applies log_2(n) over and over again until n=0, which is a serial process.  




- **2a.**






- **2b.**
